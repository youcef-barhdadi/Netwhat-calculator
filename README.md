Three scripts are available to help : nbr_adr, tobinary and ntw_adr.

nbr_adr : gives the number of host addresses available on a network attached to a given IP address.<br>
The argument is the CIDR number of this IP address.

tobinary : takes a decimal number, turns it into a binary.<br>
The argument is the decimal writing of the octet.
